# Run code:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 # if not exists

# 2
python3 timer.py
```
---
# Simplifying the same code by doing the same thing
```python
import os
import time

while True:
    os.system('notify-send "Time to have some tea or coffee and rest for a few minutes. Don't be tired"')
    time.sleep(1500)
```
**But this code is not accurate and does not have specific management.**
